# Financial Analytics Projects
## Internship at Maxizo Trading LLP

**Note:** The examples and implementations shown here are simplified demonstrations of the actual work performed during the internship. Due to confidentiality requirements, the original code, data, and specific implementation details cannot be shared.

### Project 1: Financial Data-Based Recommendations
Developed a recommendation system that analyzes financial market data to provide strategic investment suggestions. The system incorporates:
- Multiple technical indicators for market analysis
- Pattern recognition algorithms for trend identification
- Risk assessment metrics for portfolio optimization
- Custom scoring mechanisms for investment opportunities

**Example Implementation:**
- Created a simplified version showcasing the basic architecture
- Demonstrated the integration of technical indicators
- Illustrated the recommendation generation workflow

### Project 2: Strategic Trading System
Designed and implemented an automated trading strategy framework that:
- Processes real-time market data
- Identifies trading opportunities based on predefined criteria
- Manages risk through position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms
- Generates trading signals using statistical analysis

**Technical Implementation:**
- Built various statistical models including SARIMAX for time series forecasting
- Implemented LSTM networks for pattern recognition
- Utilized FinBERT for sentiment analysis of financial news
- Developed custom indicators for market analysis

### Project 3: Similarity-Based Recommendation Engine
Engineered a system that identifies similar financial instruments based on:
- Historical price movements
- Fundamental metrics
- Market correlation analysis
- Volume and liquidity patterns

**Key Features:**
- Implemented clustering algorithms for grouping similar instruments
- Developed similarity metrics specific to financial data
- Created visualization tools for relationship analysis
- Built a recommendation engine based on similarity scores

## Technologies Used
- Python for core implementation
- Statistical libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels)
- Machine Learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
- Financial analysis tools
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Plotly)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Time Series Analysis
- Machine Learning in Finance
- Natural Language Processing
- Statistical Modeling
- Financial Market Analysis
- Risk Management
- Algorithm Development
- Data Processing and Analysis

## Note on Confidentiality
The actual implementation details, model parameters, and trading strategies developed during the internship are proprietary and cannot be shared. The code examples and demonstrations in this repository are simplified versions created specifically for portfolio demonstration purposes, using public data and general implementation approaches.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional data sources
- Enhancement of prediction models
- Optimization of execution strategies
- Implementation of advanced risk management techniques
