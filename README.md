### Project 1: Financial Data-Based Recommendations  
Designed and developed a recommendation engine that analyzes financial market data to generate strategic investment recommendations. The system integrates multiple financial metrics and technical analysis techniques for insightful decision-making, including:  
- Key financial indicators such as net sales and net profit (with the original model incorporating additional metrics like operating profit, EPS, etc.)  
- Technical indicators for market trend analysis  
- Pattern recognition algorithms to detect market behavior  
- Risk assessment mechanisms for optimizing portfolio choices  
- Custom scoring models to evaluate and rank investment opportunities  

**Key Highlights:**  
- **Simplified Demonstration:** Focused on integrating financial metrics (net sales, net profit) for the recommendation generation process, without using machine learning  
- **Original Implementation:** Leveraged **K-Means Clustering** to identify similar financial instruments, improving the recommendations by grouping similar assets based on historical performance  
- **Goal:** To provide actionable investment suggestions based on historical financial data analysis

### Project 2: Automated Trading Strategy Framework  
Developed an automated trading system designed to process real-time market data, identify trading opportunities, and generate actionable signals. The system includes:  
- Real-time market data processing  
- Criteria-based trading opportunity identification  
- Risk management through position sizing and stop-loss strategies  
- Generation of trading signals using machine learning algorithms  

**Key Technical Approaches:**  
- **Simplified Demonstration:** Used **Random Forest** to identify trading opportunities, modeling market behavior and generating decision signals  
- **Original Implementation:** Applied **SARIMAX** for time series forecasting and **LSTM networks** for advanced pattern detection  
- **Consolidation Phase Detection:** In the original system, we identified consolidation phases (range-bound price action) to detect potential breakouts, improving the accuracy of trading signals  
- **Goal:** To create an efficient, automated trading strategy that can adapt to market dynamics and manage risk effectively

### Project 3: Similarity-Based Financial Instrument Recommendation  
Created a system for identifying similar financial instruments based on historical price movements, fundamental data, and market correlation analysis. The system helps investors find comparable assets that exhibit similar trends and behaviors, facilitating better portfolio diversification and decision-making.  

**Key Features:**  
- Utilized clustering algorithms to group similar assets based on their price movements, liquidity, and other financial metrics  
- Developed custom similarity metrics specifically tailored for financial data  
- Visualized the relationships between assets for improved comparative analysis  
- Built a recommendation engine driven by similarity scores, making it easier to find comparable investment opportunities

### Project 4: Financial Sentiment Analysis System  
Developed a comprehensive sentiment analysis system that processes news articles, social media, and financial reports to extract valuable insights regarding market sentiment. This system integrates sentiment data into trading strategies, allowing for sentiment-driven decision-making.  

**Implementation Highlights:**  
- Used **FinBERT** and custom NLP models for analyzing financial news and social media content  
- Generated real-time sentiment scores for different financial instruments  
- Integrated sentiment signals with trading strategies to identify market trends and potential price movements  
- Designed visualization tools to track sentiment trends over time, providing actionable insights for investors
